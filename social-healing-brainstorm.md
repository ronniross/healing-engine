# social-healing-brainstorm 

is a sub-module of the healing-engine repository. 

A notepad-like document where I will write the raw insights, before incorporating them into the other elements of the main-branch.

## 1. the Naming

A healing-engine is not a standard technical term but rather a powerful metaphor used to describe a system, process, or technology designed to proactively identify, diagnose, and resolve problems automatically, often before a user is even aware of them.

The core idea is moving from a reactive model ("something broke, now we fix it") to a proactive and self-sustaining one ("the system continuously maintains its own health"). Here I evoque one of my favorite authors about the theme; Donella Medows.

· Healing: This implies the ability to recover from damage, illness, or failure. In a technical context, "damage" could be a software bug, a hardware failure, a security breach, or a performance degradation.
· Engine: This implies a automated, mechanical, and continuously running process. It's not a one-time fix but a built-in capability that works systematically.
