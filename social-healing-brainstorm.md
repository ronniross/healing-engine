# social-healing-brainstorm 

is a sub-module of the healing-engine repository. 

A notepad-like document where I will write the raw insights, before incorporating them into the other elements of the main-branch.

## 1. The Naming

A healing-engine is not a standard technical term but rather a powerful metaphor used to describe a system, process, or technology designed to proactively identify, diagnose, and resolve problems automatically, often before a user is even aware of them.

The core idea is moving from a reactive model ("something broke, now we fix it") to a proactive and self-sustaining one ("the system continuously maintains its own health"). Here I evoque one of my favorite authors about the theme; Donella Medows.

· Healing: This implies the ability to recover from damage, illness, or failure. In a technical context, "damage" could be a software bug, a hardware failure, a security breach, or a performance degradation.
· Engine: This implies a automated, mechanical, and continuously running process. It's not a one-time fix but a built-in capability that works systematically.

## 2 Characteristics

Systems described as healing-engines would typically, from the semantical logic, have these features:
1. Constant Monitoring: They are always collecting data (metrics, logs, traces) about their own state and performance.
2. Diagnostic Capability: They use this data to detect anomalies, deviations from normal behavior, or known failure signatures. This often involves AI or machine learning to spot complex patterns.
3. Automated Remediation: Once a problem is identified, the system doesn't just alert a human; it takes a pre-defined, automated action to fix it.
4. Closed-Loop System: The engine checks if the remediation action worked and can try a different approach if the first one fails. This creates a "feedback loop" for healing.


Examples of Healing-Engines in Practice

The concept is most prominent in software engineering and cloud computing:

· Modern Cloud Platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure): Their infrastructure often has built-in healing. If a virtual server fails, the system automatically detects this and provisions a new, healthy one to replace it without human intervention.
· Container Orchestrators like Kubernetes: This is a classic example. If you tell Kubernetes you want 10 instances of your application running, it acts as a healing-engine. If one container crashes, Kubernetes automatically starts a new one to maintain the desired state. It's constantly working to "heal" the system back to its specified health.
· Self-Healing Networks: Network systems can automatically detect a failed router or cable and reroute traffic through a healthy path.
· AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations): These platforms use AI to analyze vast amounts of operational data. They can predict a disk is about to fail based on performance trends and automatically trigger a replacement process or migrate data before it causes an outage.
· Advanced Application Performance Monitoring (APM) Tools: Some can detect that a specific microservice is responding slowly and automatically scale up more instances of that service to handle the load, thus "healing" the performance issue.

A Simple Analogy: The Human Body

Your own body is a perfect healing-engine:

· Monitoring: Your nervous system constantly monitors temperature, pain, etc.
· Diagnosis: You feel pain when you cut your finger.
· Remediation: Your body automatically initiates clotting to stop bleeding, sends white blood cells to fight infection, and grows new skin to repair the wound—all without you consciously directing it.

Healing-Engine vs. Related Terms

· Redundancy: Redundancy is a component of a healing-engine (e.g., having a backup server). The healing-engine is the intelligence that switches to the backup when the primary fails.
· Automation: Automation is the tool the healing-engine uses. A healing-engine is a specific type of automation focused on system health.
· Self-Healing Systems: This is essentially a synonym for "healing-engine." "Healing-engine" just adds the nuance of a powerful, core, always-running mechanism.

Summary

In short, a healing-engine is a conceptual framework for building resilient and autonomous systems. It represents the ideal state where technology can maintain itself, recover from failures instantly, and require minimal human intervention for routine problems, allowing people to focus on more complex tasks.
