Tatiana Coelho de Sampaio has dedicated over 25 years to pioneering a biomimetic treatment for spinal cord injuries by developing many interdisciplinary research about Polylaminin, a polymer that mimics the regenerative "tunnels" of laminin found in peripheral nerves to provide a structural bridge for axons to regrow within the otherwise non-regenerative environment of the central nervous system.

In a spinal cord injury, the cells of the central nervous system lose their natural capacity to produce the necessary environment for regeneration.

Peripheral nerves (outside the spine and brain) do have the capacity to regenerate. They form "tunnels" or "tubes" stuffed with laminin, and axons grow inside them.

The  Solution in Her work involves mimicking this natural process ("Biomimetic") by using Polylaminin to form conduits where the axon can grow, effectively bridging the gap in spinal injuries.
